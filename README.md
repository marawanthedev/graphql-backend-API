## Build a GRAPHQL API

1. Create a GraphQL endpoint on (/graphql) and multiple queries for comments, posts, post with an option for sort column. Consume data the API endpoints provided in 
	- Comments endpoint – https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments
	- View Single Post endpoint – https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/{post_id}
	- View All Posts endpoint – https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

2. Search API 
Make the graphql "comments" query to accept a search string that allows a user to filter the comments based on all the available fields. Your solution needs to be scalable. 

## Additional

- You should build the API with code reusability, readability and maintainability in mind.
- You are also encouraged to show off knowledge in advance concepts in the framework/technology which the job position required within the confinement of the time and use cases of the test.

## Notes

- Once completed, send us a screenshot of your api response for Question 1 & 2. 
- Make your repo public, and send us the link for us to review
